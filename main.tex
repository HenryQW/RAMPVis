%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
  This paper offers a retrospective view on the early development stages of EnsembleVis, a visualization dashboard specifically crafted to support modelers in interpreting a simulation model utilized to forecast COVID-19 trends. The voluntary effort behind this dashboard was contributed collaboratively with the Scottish COVID-19 Response Consortium (SCRC) with the objective of facilitating an enhanced comprehension of the pandemic's complex dynamics via modeling of a real-world dataset collected by NHS Scotland during the first wave of the outbreak. This retrospective chronicles the design and development journey of the system, supplemented by feedback from domain experts, all taking place amidst the exceptional circumstances of an unprecedented pandemic. The outcome of this volunteer work is a streamlined relationship discovery process between various sets of simulation input parameters and their respective outcomes, that leverages the power of information visualization and visual analytics (VIS). We hope that this retrospective will serve as an insightful resource for future effort in visualization for pandemic and emergency responses, and promote mutually beneficial engagement between scientific communities.
