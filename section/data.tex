The data used in our work includes simulation parameters and outcomes from an \ac{ABC-SMC} inference model \cite{toni2008Approximate} developed by a group of modelers from Durham University, the University of Edinburgh, the University of Exeter, the University of Glasgow, and the London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine.
The pandemic data used for the simulation was collected by NHS Scotland during the first wave of the outbreak in Scotland spanning a period of 59 days \cite{scrc2020Covid19}.

\begin{samepage}
The model was built to analyze the pandemic data and infer the parameters of the model that best fit the data.
The model accepts 16 input parameters (see \Cref{tab:input_params}), and a random seed facilitates the generation of 160 distinct sets of configurations for these input parameters.
The model then employs these configurations as the initial input to perform 1,000 simulation iterations. As the outcome of these simulations, 160 sets of predictions are generated, each containing 13 output parameters, as shown in \Cref{tab:output_param}.

    }

Upon receiving the data, we consulted the modelers to gain insights into the conventional workflow they employ for data processing, as well as the significance and the underlying meaning associated with each input and output parameter. As constant parameters such as $K$ and $rrd$ do not affect the simulation results, they are not rendered in our visual designs.

It is worth mentioning that after plotting the output data using a line chart, an error was immediately spotted, see \Cref{fig:1st-line}, where an unusual spike can be observed on day 20.
The modelers were notified and the bug was fixed.
However, the rectified output file was never made available to us.
