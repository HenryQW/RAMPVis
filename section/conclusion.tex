\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we present the stories behind the development of EnsembleVis, an interactive dashboard designed to visualize the input parameters and outcomes of an \ac{ABC-SMC} inference model used to analyze COVID-19 data collected during the first wave of the outbreak in Scotland.

Given the multitude of uncertainties and challenges during this exceptional period, a considerable amount of information was unavailable to us during the development process. It was only through the Scottish COVID-19 Response Consortium Stakeholder Report \cite{abdalla2021Scottish}, published in late 2021, and various publications \cite{chen2022RAMPVIS,dykes2022Visualizationb,khan2022Propagating,khan2022Rapid,rydow2023RAMPVIS} that unveiled the remarkable endeavors undertaken by other volunteer teams, that we gained additional insight and details.

We hope that our experience serves as a valuable source of insight on how VIS research and techniques can play a crucial role in emergency response initiatives and aid in effectively preparing for future emergencies.
