\section{Limitations and Future Work}

\subsection{Compromises and Imperfections of the Initial Prototype}

Describe improvements that could be made and provide some criticisms of intial work.  We could call this an ad-hoc pilot prototype.

Comprimising Conditions

The ad-hoc nature of the project due to the unprecedented environment and pandemic response.

Trying to coordinate amongst a very large group.

The group membership itself was dynamic.

Trying to bridge the gap between two unfamiliar groups

Not knowing precisely where the project was heading

Imperfections of the layout due to not knowing what the final product should look like.

Non-ideal utilization of screen-space for the same reason, probably should be a multiscreen display design, or with collapsible views.
