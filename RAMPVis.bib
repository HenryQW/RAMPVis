In addition to numerous challenges in epidemiology, healthcare, biosciences, and social sciences, there has been an urgent need to develop and provide visualisation and visual analytics (VIS) capacities to support emergency responses under difficult operational conditions. In this paper, we report the experience of a group of VIS volunteers who have been working in a large research and development consortium and providing VIS support to various observational, analytical, model-developmental, and disseminative tasks. In particular, we describe our approaches to the challenges that we have encountered in requirements analysis, data acquisition, visual design, software design, system development, team organisation, and resource planning. By reflecting on our experience, we propose a set of recommendations as the first step towards a methodology for developing and providing rapid VIS capacities to support emergency responses.},

In describing and comparing a series of related projects that were undertaken in unprecedented conditions, our hope is that this unique report, and its rich interactive supplementary materials, will guide the scientific community in embracing visualization in its observation, analysis and modelling of data as well as in disseminating findings. Equally we hope to encourage the visualization community to engage with impactful science in addressing its emerging data challenges.

  abstract = {The analysis of large dynamic networks poses a challenge in many fields, ranging from large bot-nets to social networks. As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization- a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown - right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the user's overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.},

Yet real world data is rarely just graph-structured, but instead exhibits multiple facets, such as multivariate attributes, or spatial and temporal frames of reference. In an effort to display different facets of a graph, such a wealth of visualization techniques has been developed in the past that current surveys focus on a single additional facet only in order to enumerate and classify them. This report builds on existing graph visualization surveys for the four common facets of partitions, attributes, time, and space. It contributes a generic high-level categorization of faceted graph visualization that subsumes the existing classifications, which can be understood as facet-specific refinements of the resulting categories. Furthermore, it extends beyond existing surveys by applying the same categorization to graph visualizations with multiple facets. For each of the introduced categories and considered facets, this overview provides visualization examples to illustrate instances of their realization.},

Operationally, we separate the tasks of data management, visual designs, and plots and dashboard deployment in order to streamline the development workflow. Technically, we utilize: an ontology to bring datasets, visual designs, and deployable plots and dashboards under the same management framework; multi-criteria search and ranking algorithms for discovering potential datasets that match a visual design; and a purposely-design user interface for propagating each visual design to appropriate datasets (often in tens and hundreds) and quality-assuring the propagation before the deployment. This technical solution has been used in the development of the RAMPVIS infrastructure for supporting a consortium of epidemiologists and modeling scientists through visualization.},

It is our view that there is still much research to be done, but the subject is changing and developing as a tool for visual analytics. This paper provides the "state of the art' of CMV, it describes areas that should be developed further and looks at what the future may hold for coordinated and multiple views.},

It contains three major components: (1) a data flow model that helps to abstractly describe visual parameter space analysis problems independent of their application domain; (2) a set of four navigation strategies of how parameter space analysis can be supported by visualization tools; and (3) a characterization of six analysis tasks. Based on our framework, we analyze and classify the current body of literature, and identify three open research gaps in visual parameter space analysis. The framework and its discussion are meant to support visualization designers and researchers in characterizing parameter space analysis problems and to guide their design and evaluation processes.},

The algorithm is applied to several well-known biological systems, for which parameters and their credible intervals are inferred. Moreover, we develop ABC SMC as a tool for model selection; given a range of different mathematical descriptions, ABC SMC is able to choose the best model using the standard Bayesian model selection apparatus.},
