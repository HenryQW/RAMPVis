  abstract = {Recent advances in technology have brought major breakthroughs in data collection, enabling a large amount of data to be gathered over time and thus generating time series. Mining this data has become an important task for researchers and practitioners in the past few years, including the detection of outliers or anomalies that may represent errors or events of interest. This review aims to provide a structured and comprehensive state-of-the-art on unsupervised outlier detection techniques in the context of time series. To this end, a taxonomy is presented based on the main aspects that characterize an outlier detection technique.},

  abstract = {The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein transcription factor family is the most widely distributed transcription factor family in eukaryotes. Members of this family play important roles in secondary metabolic biosynthesis, signal transduction, and plant resistance. Research on the bHLH family in animals is more extensive than that in plants, and members of the family in plants are classified according to the classification criteria for those in animals. To date, no research on the bHLH gene family in Pinus massoniana (Masson pine) has been reported. In this study, we identified 88 bHLH genes from four transcriptomes of Masson pine and performed bioinformatics analysis. These genes were divided into 10 groups in total. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression levels of the six genes increased under abiotic stress and hormone treatments. These findings will facilitate further studies on the functions of bHLH transcription factors.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection is a problem with applications for a wide variety of domains; it involves the identification of novel or unexpected observations or sequences within the data being captured. The majority of current anomaly detection methods are highly specific to the individual use case, requiring expert knowledge of the method as well as the situation to which it is being applied. The Internet of Things (IoT) as a rapidly expanding field offers many opportunities for this type of data analysis to be implemented, however, due to the nature of the IoT, this may be difficult. This review provides a background on the challenges which may be encountered when applying anomaly detection techniques to IoT data, with examples of applications for the IoT anomaly detection taken from the literature. We discuss a range of approaches that have been developed across a variety of domains, not limited to IoT due to the relative novelty of this application. Finally, we summarize the current challenges being faced in the anomaly detection domain with a view to identifying potential research opportunities for the future.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a framework to utilize multivariate time series data to automatically identify reoccurring events, e.g., resembling failure patterns in real-world manufacturing data by combining selected data mining techniques. The use case revolves around the auxiliary polymer manufacturing process of drying and feeding plastic granulate to extrusion or injection molding machines. The overall framework presented in this paper includes a comparison of two different approaches towards the identification of unique patterns in the real-world industrial data set. The first approach uses a subsequent heuristic segmentation and clustering approach, the second branch features a collaborative method with a built-in time dependency structure at its core (TICC). Both alternatives have been facilitated by a standard principle component analysis PCA (feature fusion) and a hyperparameter optimization (TPE) approach. The performance of the corresponding approaches was evaluated through established and commonly accepted metrics in the field of (unsupervised) machine learning. The results suggest the existence of several common failure sources (patterns) for the machine. Insights such as these automatically detected events can be harnessed to develop an advanced monitoring method to predict upcoming failures, ultimately reducing unplanned machine downtime in the future.},

  abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research.},
